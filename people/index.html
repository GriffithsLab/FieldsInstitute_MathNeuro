Through his work with Dr. Mcintosh and colleagues in Europe and the US, he is an active contributor to the scientific, software development, and educational missions of the <a href=https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei target=_blank>Virtual Brain Project</a>.</p><hr><h3 id=dr-davide-momi>Dr. Davide Momi</h3><p><strong><em>Post-Doctoral Fellow</em></strong></p><div align=right><img src=/img/Davide_pic2.jpg style="margin:50px 50px 100px" align=right width=250></div><p>Research Interests:<br>Davide completed his Ph.D. at the Department of Neuroscience, Imaging and Clinical Sciences at the University G. d&rsquo;Annunzio of Chieti. As part of his PhD, Davide attended a period abroad as a visiting PhD student at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging in Boston. Prior to his doctoral studies, he obtained a Master’s degree in Neurosciences and Neuro-Psychological Rehabilitation from the University of Bologna and a Bachelor’s in psychology from the University of Perugia.
Davide has experience with multimodal neuroimaging data (e.g. DWI, fMRI, ASL) analysis, TMS applications, EEG data collection and analysis, quantitative structural MRI assessment (e.g. brain morphometry, cortical thickness, etc.), machine learning, cognitive tasks development with a growing passion for simulations of network-level macroscale brain dynamics. His main interest is focused on predicting the TMS signal propagation at the network-level, based on neuroimaging and electrophysiological data.
At the WBMG, Davide will be working on several projects which will involve multimodal neuroimaging, non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS, TES) and whole-brain modelling. The primary aim of his project is to predict TMS outcomes by combining computational, neuroimaging and electrophysiological approaches.</p><p>Trivia about Davide:<br>As a proud Italian, Davide never forgets to renew his membership for the “fighting against pineapple on pizza” (a.k.a. Hawaiian pizza) movement. He conducts a healthy lifestyle. He goes to the gym; he likes to hike and go for walks surrounded by nature. Davide is an enthusiastic basketball fan and he used to play semi-pro in the past. He is 6 ft 6 in. tall and is gradually getting used to his height.</p><hr><h3 id=shreyas-harita>Shreyas Harita</h3><p><strong><em>Ph.D. Student</em></strong></p><div align=right><img src=/img/sh_pic.jpg style="margin:50px 50px 100px" align=right width=250></div><p>Research Interests:<br>Shreyas is a Ph.D. student who joined the lab as a Research Trainee in May, 2019. His research interests lie in the use of connectome based neural mass modeling to study neural population activity, and how it changes in response to brain stimulation and in neuropathological conditions. The primary aims of his research project are as follows:<br>- To investigate the stimulation-induced network propagation and connectivity patterns in the human brain. He hopes to achieve a better understanding of this using brain stimulation techniques like TMS and multimodal brain imaging techniques such as structural MRI, fMRI, DTI, and EEG.<br>- To study how individual variability in brain geometry affects responses to brain stimulation, and how this information can inform neuro-navigation techniques to improve the identification of potential TMS targets.</p><p>Trivia about Shreyas:<br>Shreyas claims to be the &lsquo;funny&rsquo; one. No one else sees it. Shreyas&rsquo; favourite cuisines include Indian, Mexican, Arabic and Italian. He is the unofficial social director for the students at the lab and while no one really appointed him, they like the fact that he tries to bring people together. Shreyas leads an active lifestyle. He plays football (soccer), swims and enjoys biking (even in the winter!) within the city and on natural trails. Shreyas is an avid chess player and enjoys playing blitz and bullet chess.</p><hr><h3 id=sorenza-bastiaens>Sorenza Bastiaens</h3><p><strong><em>Ph.D. Student</em></strong></p><div align=right><img src=/img/sorenza_pic.jpg style="margin:50px 50px 100px" align=right width=250></div><p>Research Interests:<br>Sorenza officially joined the lab in January, 2021. She completed her M.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London, with a final year project at the Neural Coding department. She first worked with Dr. John Griffiths during Google Summer of Code 2020 where she developed a python package for running validation tests on models generating a neural power spectrum.
Sorenza&rsquo;s research in the lab is focused on mathematical modelling of large-scale brain network dynamics, with a focus on measured alpha oscillations observed in EEG. The aim of her project is to use and extend these computational models to better understand the role of brain rhythms in large-scale brain networks. She is also interested in understanding how brain stimulation affects these networks, which is crucial to finding treatments for neurological diseases.
Sorenza is currently applying her skills in computational neuroscience, neuroimaging and signal processing to compare and analyze different cortico-cortical and corticothalamic models such as the Jansen-Rit, Wilson-Cowan and Robinson models.</p><p>Trivia about Sorenza:<br>Sorenza is the &lsquo;sporty&rsquo; one. She is always down for pretty much any physical activity and particularly loves to play football (aka soccer), tennis, and loves to go running and hiking. She claims to have a mild coffee dependency. Her day has to start with a cup of coffee, it is non-negotiable apparently. The rest of her day involves some form of working out and meditation routine, followed by a session of reading. Sorenza is no stranger to the world of video games and enjoys playing action-adventure and battle royale games. She is a huge fan of Harry Potter (#Gryffindor) and sci-fi shows. Her secret talent is juggling and bad singing.</p><hr><h3 id=kevin-kadak>Kevin Kadak</h3><p><strong><em>Ph.D. Student</em></strong></p><div align=right><img src=/img/kevinkadak-image.jpg style="margin:50px 50px 100px" align=right width=250></div><p>Research Interests:<br>Kevin is a Ph.D. student who joined the lab in September, 2020. His research focuses on modelling synaptic plasticity dynamics in the brain to better optimize TMS stimulation parameters for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Within the theories of calcium-dependent plasticity and metaplasticity, he will be expanding current synaptic simulation models to encompass E-fields estimates, white matter connectivity, cortical geometry, and corticothalamic oscillations to project patient-specific stimulation protocols. This may aid in more robust, long-term neural rewiring and treatment. Both structural and functional imaging techniques, including fMRI and EEG, will be utilized to inform these models.<br>He looks forward to leveraging his previous experience in modelling zebrafish decision patterns towards further refining his computational skillset and, most ideally, constructing novel frameworks for applied clinical use.</p><p>Trivia about Kevin:<br>When the world isn’t collapsing in on itself, Kevin enjoys Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, thrift shopping, bothering others with puns, and practicing guitar despite never actually managing to improve at it. Kevin is a firm believer in carbonated water, pineapple on pizza (DO NOT put him on a group project with Davide!), and cutting sandwiches diagonally. He also spends his spare time convincing the world that Sky High (2005) is a cinematic masterpiece. When not involved with one of these activities, Kevin is probably squinting at code documentation, confused.</p><hr><h3 id=taha-morshedzadeh>Taha Morshedzadeh</h3><p><strong><em>M.Sc.

You can always find him up to some shenanigans on Strava. He also redecorates his home almost every two weeks. He says he doesn&rsquo;t need to see a therapist about this and promises that he&rsquo;s good. Taha enjoys listening to and singing Persian traditional music and is trying to get into composing as well! Taha would like to use this tribune to support Davide in his fight against all evil (i.e., pineapple pizza).</p><hr><h3 id=parsa-oveisi>Parsa Oveisi</h3><p><strong><em>M.A.Sc.

Parsa’s overarching interest in learning about new frameworks in which the
functioning of the brain can be described. Currently, Parsa is working on data acquisition of concurrent EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
recordings using the Kernel Flow ™ headset. He is then using this data, as well as other EEG and fMRI/fNIRS datasets, to develop a deep learning-based whole brain
model that can be fitted to individual brains. The model can then be used to predict empirical EEG and hemodynamic responses, as well as shedding light on how
patterns from these different modalities arise and interact. Parsa officially joined the lab as a Master&rsquo;s student in September 2022.</p><p>Trivia about Parsa:<br>Parsa has a spur-of-the-moment attitude in picking up new hobbies and sports. Sources say he picked up archery by fantasizing about being a steppe horse archer
of old, though it cannot be confirmed. You will usually find him at his desk (yes, his. So don’t book it!) taking advantage of the extra monitor. If you look closely,
however, you will find that where he actually is, is in a state of utter confusion. The keyboard might be being pressed but no actual progress is being made. If you ever need to talk to him, just follow the scent of black tea, or alternatively, start criticizing Lord of the Rings. He will find you.</p><hr><h3 id=andrew-clappison>Andrew Clappison</h3><p><strong><em>M.Sc.
