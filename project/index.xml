We use mathematical models describing neural population activity on the scale of millimetres to centimetres, together with network structure from macaque histology or diffusion MRI fibre tracking, to simulate (approximately) whole-brain activity measurements of the kind measured by fMRI and M/EEG. These techniques are gradually allowing us to obtain more mechanistic insights into observed patterns in neuroimaging data relating to the resting state, oscillations, and the impact of neurological and neurodegenerative disease.</description></item><item><title>Modelling brain stimulation</title><link>/project/brain_stimulation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/project/brain_stimulation/</guid><description>Brain stimulation is both a fundamental tool for studying basic principles of neuronal function, and an increasingly used therapeutic technique in clinical neurology and neuropsychiatry. Our work on computational models of neurostimulation spans both of these domains, with particular focus on oscillatory network dynamics and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy for major depressive disorder.
Our recent work on this has explored brain stimulation in the thalamocortical system. Driving this system with periodic electric stimulation produces Arnold Tongues and resonance effects that depend on both the noise and the time delay structure of the underlying neural system, as well as its current state - which (like the EEG) shows endogeneous fluctuations between regimes of synchronous alpha activity and periods of relatively more asynchronous high-frequency activity.</description></item><item><title>Modelling brain damage</title><link>/project/brain_damage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/project/brain_damage/</guid><description>The effects of white matter damage on cognitive and neural function is a subject of major interest for the group. Earlier work studied how different spatial profiles of damage following stroke resulted in differential types of linguistic impairments. A large part of our current work asks similar questions from a more systems level perspective: what is the impact of a given spatial profile of damage on the topological structure and dynamic behaviour in connectome-based neural mass models?</description></item></channel></rss>
