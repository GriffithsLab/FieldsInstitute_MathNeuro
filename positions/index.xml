What on this page? The following is a set of notes that I have compiled to help potential applicants to
a) Understand what opportunities are available with us
b) Understand how to go about the process of enquiring and, where necessary, formally applying for positions
Who does it apply to? Some of the info below is specific to certain types of positions (eg for grad school), but a lot of it applies for all levels from undegrad to post doc.</description></item></channel></rss>
