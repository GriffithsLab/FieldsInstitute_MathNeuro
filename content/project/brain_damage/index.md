The effects of white matter damage on cognitive and neural function has been a subject of major interest for me for many years. In my PhD work and earlier I studied how different spatial profiles of damage following stroke resulted in differential types of linguistic impairments.i


A large part of my current work asks similar questions from a more systems level perspective: what is the impact of a given spatial profile of damage on the topological structure and dynamic behaviour in connectome-based neural mass models? In order to help address questions like this, I have built a software library, ConWhAt, for connectome-based white matter atlas analysis. This allows the construction of 'damaged' brain networks for a given spatial profile of damage, obviating the need to run complicated tractography analyses in individual patients.
