Models of brain stimulation, and particularly how periodic brain stimulation interacts with ongoing neural oscillations, is a major focus of my current work with Dr. Lefebvre. We find that a thalamocortical loop motif consisting of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neuronal populations, and excitatory (relay) and inhibitory (reticular) thalamic nuclei, can reproduce a large amount of the empirical pheonomena measured with resting state M/EEG (Griffiths & Lefebvre, in press). We are now investigating how the topological structure of the cortex interacts with the rhythmogenic properties of this base circuit motif.

Driving this system with periodic electric stimulation produces Arnold Tongues and resonance effects that depend on both the noise and the time delay structure of the underlying neural system, as well as its current state - which (like the EEG) shows endogeneous fluctuations between regimes of synchronous alpha activity and periods of relatively more asynchronous high-frequency activity.
