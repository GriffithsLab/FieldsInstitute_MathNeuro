A main overarching theme of most of the work I do is meso/macroscopic computational models of neural dynamics. I use mathematical models describing neural population activity on the scale of millimetres to centimetres, together with network structure from macaque histology or diffusion MRI fibre tracking, to simulate (approximately) whole-brain activity measurements of the kind measured by fMRI and M/EEG. These techniques are gradually allowing us to obtain more mechanistic insights into observed patterns in neuroimaging data relating to the resting state, oscillations, and the impact of neurological and neurodegenerative disease.

 

Much of my work in this area is based around usage and development of the modelling and neuroinformatics software platform the The Virtual Brain (TVB), the brainchild of my boss Randy McIntosh and colleague Vik Jirsa. As a member of the TVB team I provide technical support on the Forum, and also teach at our regular official (and unofficial) TVB workshops.
