After several months' lead-in and build-up, I'm delighted to announce that the KCNI WBMG / GriffLab is now officially 'open for business'. Recruitment is now getting underway for post-docs, graduate students, and undergrads (see [here](www.grifflab.com/positions) for more details). This ramp-up phase is being done in parallel with the KCNI computational genomics ([triplab](https://triplab.org)) and microcircuit modelling ([haylab](https://www.haybrainlab.com/)) groups, and there will be a lots of ideas, skills, and research exchange between our three teams in the coming months and years. 

A big buzz right now amongst the various KCNI teams (which currently is numbering around 20 people, and will probably double in the next year or two) is our transition in a few weeks over to the fancy new open-plan space on the top floor of 250 college street. In addition to the stunning view of Toronto this will feature a lot of cool tech, and a very modern 'team-science' office culture. I'll be writing more about this here soon. 

Apart from the inevitable admin barrage of starting a new job, there's plenty of exciting things happening at the moment. I outlined some of the plans and progress to date for the KCNI WBMG in my talk at the CAMH Campbell symposium 2 weeks ago. Much of this is given in summary form in the sections of this site, and will of course be expanded on in due course. With my colleagues at NeurotechTO we are co-organizing a workshop in March with OBI and INCF, aimed at developing exchange between academic research and private companies in the neurotech sector. With KCNI colleagues we are organizing a BrainHack in April as a satellite event ahead of the Canadian Neuroscience Association annual meeting, which is in Toronto this year. A few invitations have come in to exciting meetings on neuroinformatics and computational neuroscience later in the year in cool places like Princeton and Barcelona, which I'm sure will be very productive. Again, watch this space for updates and summaries of these and other happenings ;)
