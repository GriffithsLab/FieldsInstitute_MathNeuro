[CV](/files/JG_CV.pdf)  

Dr. Griffiths is a cognitive and computational neuroscientist from North-West Europe. He completed his undergraduate training in psychology and philosophy at the University of Warwick, and graduate training in neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience at the University of York (advisor Prof. Gary Green) and University of Cambridge (advisor Prof. Lorraine Tyler). He then worked as a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Sydney School of Physics (with Prof. Peter Robinson), and then at the Rotman Research Institute (with Dr. Randy McIntosh) and Krembil Research Institute (with Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre) in Toronto, Canada. He joined the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH and the University of Toronto as a Scientist and Assistant Professor in January 2019. 

Dr. Griffiths has a strong technical expertise in multimodal neuroimaging data analysis, scientific computing, and numerical simulations of large-scale brain dynamics. Through his work with Dr. Mcintosh and colleagues in Europe and the US, he is an active contributor to the scientific, software development, and educational missions of the [Virtual Brain Project](https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei).

### Shreyas Harita
***Ph.D. Student***  

<div align="right"> <img src="/img/shreyas_harita.JPG" style="margin:50px 50px 100px 50px" align="right" width="250" /> </div>


Research Interests:   
Shreyas is a Ph.D student who joined the lab as a Research Trainee in May, 2019. His research interests lie in the use of connectome based neural mass modeling to study neural population activity, and how it changes in response to brain stimulation and in neuropathological conditions. The primary aims of his research project are as follows:  

  1) To investigate the stimulation-induced network propagation and connectivity patterns in the human brain. He hopes to achieve a better understanding of this using brain stimulation techniques like TMS and multimodal brain imaging techniques such as structural MRI, fMRI, DTI, and EEG.  
  2) To study how individual variability in brain geometry affects responses to brain stimulation, and how this information can inform neuro-navigation techniques to improve the identification of potential TMS targets.  

Trivia about Shreyas:  
Shreyas claims to be the 'funny' one. No one else sees it. Shreyas enjoys food and his favourite cuisines include Indian, Mexican, Arabic and Italian. Shreyas is the unofficial social director for the students at the KCNI and while no one really appointed him, they like the fact that he tries to bring people together for group lunches. Shreyas leads a physically active lifestyle. He goes to the gym, enjoys biking and regularly (even in the winter!) bikes, both within the city and on trails. Shreyas is an avid chess player and enjoys playing rapid, blitz and bullet chess.

### Frank Mazza  
***M.Sc. Student***  

<div align="right"> <img src="/img/frank_mazza.jpg" style="margin:50px 50px 100px 50px" align="right" width="250" /> </div>

Research Interests:    
Frank is a M.Sc student who joined the lab in September, 2019. He is co-supervised by Dr. Etay Hay. Frank is interested in identifying electrophysiological signals for diagnosis of depression and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols for treatment of depression, using computer simulations of detailed brain circuits and whole-brain networks. With previous work in identifying EEG correlates of response in a novel rTMS stimulation paradigm (OFC-rTMS), he now focuses on identifying biomarkers in brain signals for diagnosis of depression by linking cellular, circuit, and connectivity changes to signals relevant for clinical diagnosis. In addition, he is working to optimize TMS protocols using computer simulations at the local and global brain scales by simulating protocol effects on local circuits, such as circuit inhibition, and the propagation of activity to other regions in the brain.  

Trivia about Frank:  
Frank 'The Grank' Mazza. He is the lab's pretty boy. Frank is quite and likes to go about his business, often finishing his work before deadlines, be it grants, abstracts, or manuscripts. Frank does intermittent fasting. No one knows why. Frank likes to read and write about all things art and architecture. He likes to paint, ink, sketch, sculpt and lino-print. Frank has a humble garden where he likes to experiment with growing different plants. He likes to work out and is avid music fan, trying to appreciate everything that isn't country.

### Surya Pandiaraju  
***Co-op Student***  

<div align="right"> <img src="/img/suryagrifflab.jpg" style="margin:50px 50px 100px 50px" align="right" width="250" /> </div>  

Research Interests:  
Surya is a biomedical engineering student at the University of Waterloo. He is co-supervised by Dr. Andreea Diaconescu. He is interested in EEG data analysis and  brain-computer interfaces and their applications in both clinical and consumer-based settings. Currently, he is working on a project focused on designing a pipeline for clinically obtained EEG data that would generate first-level and second-level statistical analyses and is doing so by modifying currently existing tools in MATLAB.  

Trivia:  
Surya enjoys partaking in a number of hobbies including but not limited to drawing (even when he is not supposed to be), digital arts, collectible card games, video games, anime & manga, working out, exploring new restaurants, singing/whistling/beatboxing/humming in the car whilst pretending no one can hear him, and is trying to get his hand in producing after compulsively purchasing a mini MIDI keyboard after watching a video or two on his YouTube recommended list at 12am. If Surya could have any superpower, it would be universal time-control, which he could use to get back the time he spent trying to make this funny.

### Minarose Ismail  
***Summer research student***  

<div align="right"> <img src="/img/minarose_photo.jpg" style="margin:10px 50px 100px 50px" align="right" width="250" /> </div>

Minoarose was a summer research student during the summer of 2019. She was a first year undergraduate student at McMaster pursuing a bachelor in Neuroscience with a background in Python coding. Her work was in the field of computational neuroscience and her project dealt with fitting oscillations and one over frequency on MEG data using the FOOOF toolbox to parametrize the power spectra and perform summary analysis.
