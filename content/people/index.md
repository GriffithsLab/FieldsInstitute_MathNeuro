[CV](/files/JG_CV.pdf)  

Dr. Griffiths is a cognitive and computational neuroscientist from North-West Europe. He completed his undergraduate training in psychology and philosophy at the University of Warwick, and graduate training in neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience at the University of York (advisor Prof. Gary Green) and University of Cambridge (advisor Prof. Lorraine Tyler). He then worked as a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Sydney School of Physics (with Prof. Peter Robinson), and then at the Rotman Research Institute (with Dr. Randy McIntosh) and Krembil Research Institute (with Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre) in Toronto, Canada. He joined the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH and the University of Toronto as a Scientist and Assistant Professor in January 2019. 

Dr. Griffiths has a strong technical expertise in multimodal neuroimaging data analysis, scientific computing, and numerical simulations of large-scale brain dynamics. Through his work with Dr. Mcintosh and colleagues in Europe and the US, he is an active contributor to the scientific, software development, and educational missions of the [Virtual Brain Project](https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei).

Bio: I joined the Griffiths Lab as a Research Trainee in May, 2019. My project involves understanding and applying the Braintrak toolbox (developed by Peter Robinson's group) to MEG data. I obtained my Master’s degree in Neuroscience from Queen’s University in 2017. My thesis dealt with resting-state fMRI in the human brainstem and cervical spinal cord at 3T. I obtained my Bachelors of Science from the University of Toronto in 2015.

I am a first year undergraduate student at McMaster pursuing a bachelor in Neuroscience with a background in Python coding. I joined the Griffiths Lab as a research student volunteer in May 2019. I am interested in the field of computational neuroscience and currently working on fitting oscillations and one over frequency on MEG data using the FOOOF toolbox to parametrize the power spectra and perform summary analysis.
