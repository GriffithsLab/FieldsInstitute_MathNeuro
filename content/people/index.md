**Dr. John Griffiths** - *Group Lead*


I'm a neuroscientist based at the Rotman and Krembil Research Institutes in Toronto, Canada. My research uses a combination of computational modelling and neuroimaging techniques to study basic principles of brain organization, and the neural and cognitive effects of damage and disease.
 

Follow the links above to learn more about my current projects, publications, talks and teaching, code and software, and science communication.
 

You might also be interested in checking out my Digital Lab Notebook, my Github repositories, and the websites of the two research groups I work in: The McIntosh Lab and Lefebvre (Sync) Lab.
