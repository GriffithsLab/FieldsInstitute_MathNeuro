Sorenza's research in the lab is focused on mathematical modelling of large-scale brain network dynamics, with a focus on measured alpha oscillations observed in EEG. The aim of her project is to use and extend these computational models to better understand the role of brain rhythms in large-scale brain networks. She is also interested in understanding how brain stimulation affects these networks, which is crucial to finding treatments for neurological diseases.
Sorenza is currently applying her skills in computational neuroscience, neuroimaging and signal processing to compare and analyze different cortico-cortical and corticothalamic models such as the Jansen-Rit, Wilson-Cowan and Robinson models.

Trivia about Sorenza:  
Sorenza is the 'sporty' one. She is always down for pretty much any physical activity and particularly loves to play football (aka soccer), tennis, and loves to go running and hiking. She claims to have a mild coffee dependency. Her day has to start with a cup of coffee, it is non-negotiable apparently. The rest of her day involves some form of working out and meditation routine, followed by a session of reading. Sorenza is no stranger to the world of video games and enjoys playing action-adventure and battle royale games. She is a huge fan of Harry Potter (#Gryffindor) and sci-fi shows. Her secret talent is juggling and bad singing.

### Kevin Kadak
***Ph.D. Student***  

<div align="right"> <img src="/img/kevinkadak-image.jpg" style="margin:50px 50px 100px 50px" align="right" width="250" /> </div>

Research Interests:    
Kevin is a Ph.D. student who joined the lab in September, 2020. His research focuses on modelling synaptic plasticity dynamics in the brain to better optimize TMS stimulation parameters for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Within the theories of calcium-dependent plasticity and metaplasticity, he will be expanding current synaptic simulation models to encompass E-fields estimates, white matter connectivity, cortical geometry, and corticothalamic oscillations to project patient-specific stimulation protocols. This may aid in more robust, long-term neural rewiring and treatment. Both structural and functional imaging techniques, including fMRI and EEG, will be utilized to inform these models.  
He looks forward to leveraging his previous experience in modelling zebrafish decision patterns towards further refining his computational skillset and, most ideally, constructing novel frameworks for applied clinical use.    

Trivia about Kevin:  
When the world isn’t collapsing in on itself, Kevin enjoys Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, thrift shopping, bothering others with puns, and practicing guitar despite never actually managing to improve at it. Kevin is a firm believer in carbonated water, pineapple on pizza (DO NOT put him on a group project with Davide!), and cutting sandwiches diagonally. He also spends his spare time convincing the world that Sky High (2005) is a cinematic masterpiece. When not involved with one of these activities, Kevin is probably squinting at code documentation, confused.

### Parsa Oveisi 
***M.A.Sc. Student***  

<div align="right"> <img src="/img/Parsa_pic_3.jpg" style="margin:50px 50px 100px 50px" align="right" width="250" /> </div> 

Research Interests:  
Parsa joined Grifflab in September 2021 as an undergraduate research student. Parsa’s overarching interest in learning about new frameworks in which the 
functioning of the brain can be described. Currently, Parsa is working on data acquisition of concurrent EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) 
recordings using the Kernel Flow ™ headset. He is then using this data, as well as other EEG and fMRI/fNIRS datasets, to develop a deep learning-based whole brain 
model that can be fitted to individual brains. The model can then be used to predict empirical EEG and hemodynamic responses, as well as shedding light on how 
patterns from these different modalities arise and interact. Parsa officially joined the lab as a Master's student in September 2022.   

Trivia about Parsa:  
Parsa has a spur-of-the-moment attitude in picking up new hobbies and sports. Sources say he picked up archery by fantasizing about being a steppe horse archer 
of old, though it cannot be confirmed. You will usually find him at his desk (yes, his. So don’t book it!) taking advantage of the extra monitor. If you look closely, 
however, you will find that where he actually is, is in a state of utter confusion. The keyboard might be being pressed but no actual progress is being made. If you ever need to talk to him, just follow the scent of black tea, or alternatively, start criticizing Lord of the Rings. He will find you.
