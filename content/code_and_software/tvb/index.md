[The Virtual Brain (TVB)](https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei) is a modelling and neuroinformatics platform for simulating meso-scale whole-brain neural activity. TVB is the brainchild of our colleagues Randy McIntosh Viktor Jirsa, and is one of the principal tools we use in our computational modelling research work. 

As members of the 'extended' TVB team, we provide technical support on the [Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!forum/tvb-users), teach regularly at workshops, and develop new technical features and applications. 

Newbies to TVB: check out the main website and the [github organization](https://github.com/the-virtual-brain); and particularly the jupyter notebook [demos](https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-documentation/tree/master/demos) and [tutorials](https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-documentation/tree/master/tutorials). There are also a variety of handy TVB nuggets from us in the [TVB entries on the JDG LabNotebook](https://johngriffiths.github.io/LabNotebook/tag/tvb.html).
