#We work extensively with structural and functional neuroimaging data (sMRI, fMRI, DWI, MEG, EEG), employing the latest cutting-edge analysis methods to study connectivity, oscillations, and their modification by brain stimulation and drugs. This information is used to construct and constrain computational models of brain dynamics that combine [meso-scale](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mesoscopic_brain_dynamics) mathematical descriptions of neural population activity with whole-brain network structure. 

#The meso-scale approach strikes a balance between *granularity* (level of physiological detail) and *coverage* (number of brain regions included), that is well-matched to the type of information that can be obtained from modern in-vivo neuroimaging techniques. Together with colleagues in the KCNI [microcircuit modelling](www.haylab.com) and [computational genomics](https://triplab.org/) groups, we are also developing multi-scale modelling approaches that bridge cellular-level and population-level descriptions of neural activity. 

#Our long-term goal is the development simultaneously detailed and holistic in-silico computational and theoretical accounts of brain function, cognition, and their pathologies.

## Building patient-personalized brain simulations to improve interpretation of neuroimaging and neurostimulation data
<br>
Neuroscience as a field is very good at ***measuring things*** and ***poking things***. It has an impressive armoury of experimental techniques using electricity, light, acoustics, biochemistry, and more to measure and modulate neural activity in everything from a blob of cells on a dish to a conscious human in a surgical theatre or an MRI scanner. 

What neuroscience is less good at, for the most part, is ***theory***; i.e. ***understanding*** the sources of the patterns we see in our measurements, and what is actually happening in the brain when we poke it with electrical stimulation and the like. The sub-field that deals with developing theoretical mechanistic understanding of brain processes is known as ***computational neuroscience***. It does this by building mathematical models that allow us to simulate healthy brain activity ***"in-silico"***. 

In our research we bring the tools of computational neuroscience to the domains of [***neuroimaging***](addlink) and [***brain stimulation***](addlink). The paradigm we use for this, [***whole-brain modelling***](addlink), blends elements from neurophysiology, cognitive neuroscience, neuroanatomy, connectomics, complex networks, dynamical systems, machine learning, and biophysics. 

We combine whole-brain computational modelling of ***network dynamics***, ***oscillations***, ***plasticity***, and ***cognitive function*** with experimental and data analytic work across multiple neuroimaging and neurostimulation modalities (EEG, MEG, s/d/fMRI, fNIRS, TMS, TES). This unique theoretical-experimental approach is applied to questions on both ***basic principles of brain organization***, as well as how it is ***affected in neuropsychiatric and neurological disease***.
