In the whole brain modelling group at the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics (KCNI)](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) we take a "bird's-eye" approach to understanding brain organization and how it is affected in neuropsychiatric and neurological disease.

We develop and apply computational models of brain dynamics that combine meso-scale mathematical descriptions of neural population activity with large-scale network structure. 

This framework strikes a balance between *granularity* (level of physiological detail) and *coverage* (number of brain regions included) that is well-matched to the type of information that can be obtained from modern in-vivo neuroimaging techniques. 

We work closely and with a strong methodological component on human structural and functional neuroimaging data, with a focus on connectivity, oscillations, brain stimulation, and neuromodulation.

Together with colleagues in the KCNI microcircuit modelling and computational genomics groups, we are also developing multi-scale modelling approaches that bridge cellular-levle and population-level descriptions of neural activity. 

These will be central to the long-term goal of a simultaneously detailed andholistic in-silico accounts of brain functiona nd its pathologies.
