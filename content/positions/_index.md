## Graduate Students

We are looking for Masters and PhD students with strong computational skills and a keen interest in neuroimaging, computational neuroscience, and cognition and mental health. Interested students please get in touch at john.griffiths@camh.ca, including a full university transcript, resume/CV, and a 1-page statement of your research interests that also clearly outlines why you think you would be a good fit for the lab. 


### PhD Positon - Max Planck Toronto / Saarbrucken

We are looking for a PhD candidate to undertake novel research at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

The PhD research topic will focus on understanding key mechanisms that enable specific cognitive functions in the brain, such as language comprehension, using a combination of computational neuroscience, machine learning, and experimental cognitive neuroscience techniques. The student will develop novel integrations of mechanistic physiological and generative AI-based theories of brain organization, and test these by designing, conducting, and analyzing experiments using advanced neuroimaging and neurostimulation technologies (EEG, fNIRS, TMS, MEG, fMRI, including mobile w/ VR/AR integration).

See full opportunity details and application instructions [here](https://www.grifflab.com/positions/mpc-mpi-phd/).


## Undergraduate Students

We are also looking for undergraduate students with some experience in programming and data analysis. Interested students should contact Dr. Griffiths at john.griffiths@camh.ca, including your current university transcript showing grades and relevant coursework, and a few sentences that outline your interest in joining the lab.
