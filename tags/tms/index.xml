Our work on computational models of neurostimulation spans both of these domains, with particular focus on oscillatory network dynamics and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy for major depressive disorder.
Our recent work on this has explored brain stimulation in the thalamocortical system. Driving this system with periodic electric stimulation produces Arnold Tongues and resonance effects that depend on both the noise and the time delay structure of the underlying neural system, as well as its current state - which (like the EEG) shows endogeneous fluctuations between regimes of synchronous alpha activity and periods of relatively more asynchronous high-frequency activity.</description></item></channel></rss>
